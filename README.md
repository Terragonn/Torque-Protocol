# Torque Money Whitepaper

## A DeFi leveraging protocol that allows users to leverage as much as they wish against their collateral whilst providing high (currently delta neutral) interest rates to liquidity providers.

### Code

All of the most up to date code can be found in the [official repository](https://github.com/Torque-Money/Torque-Protocol). In addition the code can be verified on most blockchain explorers.

### Deployed contracts

**As of the current point in time no contracts have been deployed. If you see a contract that claims to be ours that is not here, please verify it with us first before using it**

### Motivation

The purpose of the protocol is to provide unlimited leveraging to our users. Traditional lending platforms only allow you to leverage up to a certain amount against your collateral, however we believe that this should not be the standard, and this protocol aims to remove this cap so that the only limit is the amount of liquidity in the leveraging pool.

We also wish to provide some of the best interest rates to our lenders in the market whilst providing them with a mostly market neutral return. _Please note that future changes to the protocol might make the lending strategy less market neutral_
