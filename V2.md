## Lending pool

### Liquidity pools

-   Stakers deposit collateral in exchange for LP tokens
-   LP tokens represent the percentage of the pool entitled to the owner and may be traded as ERC20 (to avoid redemption helping to lock liquidity)
-   Pool may use deposited liquidity in multiple ways
    -   Claim and unclaim - claim a portion of liquidity in the pool as your own without withdrawing it from the pool
    -   Withdrawing - directly withdraw crypto from the pool
-   Only certain tokens will be approved for use with the pool to avoid hacks and liquidity problems that could harm the protocol
-   Pool accumulates money via interest rates which fuels the market neutral strategy provided

## Oracle (upgradeable)

-   Contains a collection of price feeds that are evaluated on every price request
-   Requests price feeds
-   If the token for the price food is a LP token it calculates it from the pool itself - this way users can lock their LP tokens up as collateral and pay off their own leverage interest
-   Provides an interface for swapping collateral - this may be upgraded in future from a DEX to a manual collateral swap

## Isolated margin

-   Margin will use the underlying liquidity pool to allow users to leverage huge amounts of crypto
-   In order to leverage, users will have to deposit a minimum amount of collateral, however they will be able to leverage as much as they wish against this minimum amount. This is needed to provide a high enough incentive for a liquidator in the case that the margin level falls below the minimum.

### Long

### Short

### Interest rates

-   Interest rates are based off of the pools utilization rate and the max interest rate percentage - more borrowed = more interest
-   Interest rates are charged on a per block basis. Leveraging on top of an existing position will instantly accumulate interest on the new amount borrowed from the original block.
