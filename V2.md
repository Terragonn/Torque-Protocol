### Liquidity pools

-   Stakers deposit collateral in exchange for LP tokens
-   LP tokens represent the percentage of the pool entitled to the owner and may be traded as ERC20 (to avoid redemption helping to lock liquidity)
-   Pool may use deposited liquidity in multiple ways
    -   Claim and unclaim - claim a portion of liquidity in the pool as your own without withdrawing it from the pool
    -   Withdrawing - directly withdraw crypto from the pool

### Interest rates

-   Interest rates are based off of the utilization rate and the max interest rate percentage - more borrowed = more interest
-   Interest rates are charged on a per block basis. Leveraging on top of an existing position will instantly accumulate interest on the new amount borrowed from the original block.
-   All interest is provided back to the liquidity pool fueling the market neutral strategy providers to liquidity providers
